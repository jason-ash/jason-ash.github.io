          <p><h5>Introduction</h5>
<p>This week's <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-many-pennies-should-you-pinch/">Riddler Classic</a> explores ideal strategy in a two-player game. We take turns removing coins from two piles, and the last one to remove a coin wins. I'll use pen and paper to sketch out the logical framework, then code a flexible solution using python and dynamic programming.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The game starts with somewhere between 20 and 30 pennies, which I then divide into two piles any way I like. Then we alternate taking turns, with you first, until someone wins the game. For each turn, a player may take any number of pennies he or she likes from either pile, or instead take the same number of pennies from both piles. Each player must also take at least one penny every turn. The winner of the game is the one who takes the last penny.
<br><br>
If we both play optimally, what starting numbers of pennies (again, between 20 and 30) guarantee that you can win the game?</p>
</blockquote>
<h5>Solution</h5>
<p>I'll take a small liberty and answer the complementary question: what configurations of pennies guarantee that I <em>lose</em> the game? There are fewer combinations that satisfy this constraint, so it's easier to list them.</p>
<p><strong>With their choice of 20-30 pennies, my opponent could create three configurations that guarantee I lose the game, provided I must play first: (8, 13), (9, 15), and (11, 18). These configurations require 21, 24, and 29 pennies, respectively.</strong> If my opponent starts with any other number of pennies between 20-30, there is <em>no</em> configuration they could create that I can't win by playing optimally.</p>
<h5>Methodology</h5>
<p>I used a combination of pen and paper and computer code to solve this problem. I started by looking for patterns in a highly simplified version of the game, then I generalized those patterns to larger numbers of coins. In computer science this approach is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming">dynamic programming</a>, where we solve a complex problem by breaking it down into simpler component parts that we can solve individually and recombine later.</p>
<p>For this problem, the simplest game has just one coin. Without loss of generality, I will follow the convention that ($a$, $b$) represents the state of the game, where $a \le b$. I will assign winning states a value of 1, and losing states a value of -1. For $a=0$ and $b=1$, we can win immediately by taking the only coin available, so the expected value of (0, 1) is 1.</p>
<p>With two coins, we can have two states: (0, 2) or (1, 1). With (0, 2) we can win immediately by taking both coins from pile $b$. With (1, 1), we can win immediately by taking one coin from each pile. The expected values of (0, 2) and (1, 1) are both 1. </p>
<p>With three coins, we can have two states: (0, 3) or (1, 2). (0, 3) has a winning move by taking all three coins from pile $b$, so its expected value is 1. However, (1, 2) is more complicated. Let's list all available moves:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Begin State</th>
<th>Move</th>
<th>End State</th>
<th>Expected Value</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>(1, 2)</td>
<td>(1, 0) - take one coin from $a$</td>
<td>(0, 2)</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>(1, 2)</td>
<td>(0, 1) - take one coin from $b$</td>
<td>(1, 1)</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>(1, 2)</td>
<td>(0, 2) - take two coins from $b$</td>
<td>(0, 1)*</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>(1, 2)</td>
<td>(1, 1) - take one coin from both piles</td>
<td>(0, 1)</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td></td>
<td>*recall we always set $a \le b$</td>
<td></td>
<td></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Each of our possible moves results in a state with expected value 1... for our opponent! We can't make any move that avoids losing from this position, so the expected value of (1, 2) is -1.</p>
<p>Now we have built a small dictionary of states and expected values. Each time we solve for a larger number of coins, we can list all the possible moves, and look up the expected value of the resulting states, flipping the sign of the expected value each time to account for the fact that we take turns with our opponent. If any move produces an expected value of 1, then it means we can win if we play optimally.</p>
<p>If we continue this process by hand, we can build a small diagram of optimal decisions, shown below. Each state has a color: red states are losing, and green states are winning. To simplify the states, I've used a generic $n$ to represent some positions. (0, $n$) represents a state with a zero in one pile and any number of coins in the other. Similarly ($n$, $n$) represents a state with any number of equal coins in both piles. For example, we showed that no move from (1, 2) can win the game, because (1, 2) only connects to (0, $n$) and ($n$, $n$), which are winning states for our opponent. </p>
<p>Suppose we start at (3, 7) on our turn. Our best move is to remove 2 coins from pile $b$, putting our opponent in the unwinnable state (3, 5). The opponent may choose to remove one coin from pile $b$, giving us the state (3, 4). We will remve 2 coins from both piles, giving our opponent the unwinnable (1, 2) state, from which we've shown we will eventually win. </p>
<p><img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" src="../images/20200124-riddler.png"></p>
<p>As the diagram shows, this process becomes complicated for larger numbers of coins. At this point I turned to the computer. In python I created a class called <code>GameState</code> that tracks the number of coins in each pile and allows us to simulate potential moves and calculate expected values. For example, we can verify the expected values we calculated by hand earlier.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">GameState</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">expected_value</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="mi">1</span>
<span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">GameState</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">expected_value</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Each <code>GameState</code> simulates all possible moves we could make from a position, then calculates the expected value of the new <code>GameState</code> after we make our move. If we've calculated the new state's expected value before, we look it up from a table. Otherwise, we calculate it and store it in case we need it later.</p>
<p>We can also use the <code>GameState</code> class to identify the best move to make from any state. For example, how should we play if there are 75 coins in pile $a$ and 90 coins in pile $b$?</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span class="n">GameState</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">75</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">90</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">best_move</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">51</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">51</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The best move is to remove 51 coins from both piles. (Note, there may be several winning moves from a given position, but the code returns the move that wins the fastest. No need to delay the inevitable...) After our move, the opponent faces a new <code>GameState</code> with $a=24$ and $b=39$. What is our opponent's best move?</p>

<p>Oops - looks like no matter what our opponent does, we are guaranteed to win.</p>
<p>Finally, to answer the original question, we want to list all unwinnable states. Because we store all the expected values, we can search the database for all the losing states and return them as a list.</p>

<p>We use this list to answer the original question. With 20-30 coins, only the states (8, 13), (9, 15), and (11, 18) guarantee us to lose if we play first. Of course we can test larger numbers of coins, but I'll leave that as an exercise for the motivated reader. My full code is available below!</p>
<h5>Full Code</h5>
<p>The code for this week was fun to write. I created a class called <code>GameState</code> that represents the game, has methods to yield valid moves, calculate expected value, return the best move to make, and more. I feel like I could have kept adding more and more functionality to this class, but I tried to keep it relatively focused for now.</p>
