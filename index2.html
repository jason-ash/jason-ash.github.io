          <p>Computers continue to fascinate me. The Riddler this week deals with an explosion of combinations and math that is nearly impossible to grasp without the help of a computer. Specifically, we're interested in crafting an ideal strategy for the "numbers game" from the UK television show Countdown. The numbers game asks contestants to use four mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) with six numbers as inputs to solve for a single, three digit target. Most of the time, this can be quite difficult, especially with a 30-second time limit. However, with the help of a computer, we can solve for every possible combination of input and output to identify the strategy that gives the humans the best chance to win!</p>

          <p>I have a distinct memory of participating in my elementary school's spelling bee when I was in second grade. I was the unlikely runner-up, even though I was competing against children in third and fourth grade. What was the secret to my overperformance? Not my natural spelling ability, but rather the rules of the game - a participant is eliminated from the spelling bee after failing to spell a word correctly, which means that going last is an advantage. I was lucky enough to be the near the tail-end of the participants in my spelling bee, which surely improved my final ranking. This week's Riddler asks us to quantify that advantage.</p>

          <p>This week's riddler asks us to simulate a game of baseball using rolls of a dice. To solve this problem, we're going to treat the game of Baseball like a markov chain. Under the simplified dice framework, we identify various states of the game, a set of transition probabilities to subsequent states, and associated payoffs (runs scored) when certain states are reached as a result of game events. Using this paradigm, we can simulate innings probabilistically, count the runs scored by each team, and determine the winner.</p>

          <p>I've learned that there are many automatic differentiation libraries in the Python ecosystem. Often these libraries are also machine learning libraries, where automatic differentiation serves as a means to an end - for example in optimizing model parameters in a neural network. However, the autograd library might be one of the purest, "simplest" (relatively speaking) options out there. Its goal is to efficiently compute deriviatives of numpy code, and its API is as close to numpy as possible. This means it's easy to get started right away if you're comfortable using numpy. In particular autograd claims to be able to differentiate as many times as one likes, and I thought a great way to test this would be to apply the Taylor Series approximation to some interesting functions.</p>

          <p>This week's holiday Riddler is a twist on the classic "birthday problem". The birthday problem asks us to calculate the probability that at least two people at a party have the same birthday. Most people hearing this problem for the first time are surprised at how few people you need - roughly 23 people results in 50% odds of finding at least one pair of birthdays! For this problem, we're interested in calculating how likely we are to hear the same song more than once from a shuffled playlist. Moreover, what can we infer about the size of the playlist, given that we hear repeats roughly half the time?</p>

          <p>As a follow up to my prior article on Black-Scholes in PyTorch, I wanted to explore more complex applications of automatic differentiation. As I showed before, automatic differentiation can be used to calculate the sensitivities, or "greeks", of a stock option, even if we use monte carlo techniques to calculate option price. Many exotic options can only be priced using monte carlo techniques, so automatic differentiation may be able to provide more accurate sensitivities in less time than traditional methods.</p>

          <p>I've been experimenting with several machine learning frameworks lately, including Tensorflow, PyTorch, and Chainer. I'm fascinated by the concept of automatic differentiation. It's incredible to me that these libraries can calculate millions of partial derivatives of virtually any function with only one extra pass through the code. Automatic differentiation is critical for deep learning models, but I wanted to see how it could be applied to value financial derivatives.</p>
