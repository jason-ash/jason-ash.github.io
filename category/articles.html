          <p>It's the 256th edition of the Riddler, and though I've taken many weekends off to spend time with my newborn, I became obsessed with this week's puzzle! We're asked to play the word guessing game from Lingo, a game show. It reminds me of another one of my favorite Riddlers where we identify the best strategy for playing the math game from Countdown, another game show. The puzzle is extremely challenging, and I couldn't find an exact solution. Instead, I used Python to implement the game engine, and used some heuristics to choose words that resulted in a high score.</p>

          <p>I can never resist a good dice problem, and this week's Riddler Express is no different. In a technique called "bowling", you can try to throw a dice so it lands on one of four sides, rather than six. How could we use this to our advantage in a simplified game of craps? We'll solve this with a bit of dynamic programming - my favorite!</p>

          <p>This week's Riddler Classic was a fun way to welcome the new year. We're asked to find seven letters that maximize the score from the New York Times Spelling Bee puzzle. I use pure Python (lists, sets, and dictionaries only) to find the optimum pool of seven words.</p>

          <p>This week's Riddler tested our ability to think recursively, but surprisingly not of the coding variety. Instead, we'll use a series of equations to solve the problem analytically. Brings back memories of high school proofs... which I may or may not remember with complete fidelity.</p>

          <p>A small twist on a classic problem is this week's challenge from the Riddler. We're going to tackle an extension of the secretary problem - also known as the Sultan's Dowry problem. This classic puzzle has led to fascinating research in optimal stopping theory, which we will use to help our Sultan choose the best possible suitor. Let's dive in!</p>
