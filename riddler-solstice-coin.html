          <p><h5>Introduction</h5>
<p>As a self-professed Bayesian enthusiast, this week's <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-you-flip-the-magic-coin/">Riddler Express</a> is right up my alley! We want to calculate the odds that a coin is magical after flipping it a given number of times. Specifically, we want to calculate the number of flips before we're 99% certain the coin is actually magical. We'll use Bayes's formula to find an exact solution.</p>
<blockquote>
I have a coin with a sun on the front and a moon on the back. I claim that on most days, it’s a fair coin, with a 50 percent chance of landing on either the sun or the moon.
<br><br>
But once a year, on the summer solstice, the coin absorbs the sun’s rays and exhibits a strange power: It always comes up the opposite side as the previous flip.
<br><br>
Of course, you are skeptical of my claim. You figure there’s a 1 percent chance that the coin is magical and a 99 percent chance that it’s just an ordinary fair coin. You then ask me to “prove” the coin is magical by flipping it some number of times.
<br><br>
How many successfully alternating coin flips will it take for you to think there’s a 99 percent chance the coin is magical (or, more likely, that I’ve rigged it in some way so it always alternates)?
</blockquote>

<h5>Solution</h5>
<p><strong>It will take 14 consecutive alternating flips before we are at least 99% sure the coin is magical.</strong> This problem is a classic fit for Bayesian methods. (We've seen another great example in a <a href="https://www.jtash.com/who-wants-to-bayes-a-millionaire">prior Riddler</a> based on "Who wants to be a millionaire") Let's start by reviewing Bayes's formula, then we'll parse the problem text to identify the information we need to solve it.</p>
<p>$$P(A|B) \times P(B) = P(B|A) \times P(A)$$</p>
<p>Typically, a problem like this will give us three of the four variables, and we'll need to solve for the fourth. As we go, we'll identify what we mean when we say $A$ and $B$ in the context of this problem. Let's write down the information we have:</p>
<ul>
<li>We want to find the number of flips it will take to be 99% sure the coin is magical. Let's use a variable, $N$, to represent this unknown number. In probability notation, this means we want to find $N$ such that $P(\text{magical coin | N alternating flips}) = 0.99$.</li>
<li>Before we flip any coins, we believe the probability of a magical coin is 1%. We'll write this as $P(\text{magical coin}) = 1\%$.</li>
<li>We know that <em>if</em> the coin is magical, it will always alternate flips, no matter how many times we flip the coin. We'll re-use our variable $N$ and write $P(\text{N alternating flips | magical coin}) = 100\%$.</li>
<li>Finally, we need to calculate the probability of observing $N$ alternating flips in a row. This depends on whether we are using a fair or a magical coin, so we'll take the weighted average of both possibilities: $P(\text{N alternating flips}) = 99\% \times \frac{1}{2^N} + 1\% \times 1$.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we've identified all four variables required for Bayes's formula above. Written out, we have:</p>
<p>$$P(\text{magic | N flips}) \times P(\text{N flips}) = P(\text{N flips | magic}) \times P(\text{magic})$$</p>
<p>When we plug in our values, we get:</p>
<p>$$0.99 \times (\frac{0.99}{2^N} + 0.01) = 1 \times 0.01$$</p>
<p>Rearranging so we have $N$ on one side, we get:</p>
<p>$$2^N = \frac{\frac{99}{100}}{\frac{1}{99} - \frac{1}{100}}$$</p>
<p>Conveniently, the fraction on the right equals $9801$. So we have:</p>
<p>$$2^N = 9801$$</p>
<p>We take the log of both sides to solve for $N$, which gives us $N=13.26$. Because we can't have fractions of coin flips, and we want to be <em>at least</em> 99% sure before stopping, we should err on the side of caution and flip 14 times. This means that after 14 consecutive, alternating flips we can be 99.4% certain the coin is magical.</p></p>
