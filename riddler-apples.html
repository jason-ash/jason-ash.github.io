          <p><h5>Introduction</h5>
<p>This was a challenging <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-you-eat-an-apple-like-a-toddler/">Riddler</a> about a toddler's inefficient eating habits. Our picky toddler takes a bite from an Apple once every minute, and only if the randomly chosen spot has skin left on it. How long will it take to eat the entire apple? Spoiler - it's likely to outlast the toddler's attention span by quite some time. Here is the problem text with full details of this disastrously slow process.</p>
<blockquote>
A certain 2-year-old is eating his favorite snack: an apple. But he eats it in a very particular way. When he first receives the apple, and every minute thereafter, he rotates the apple to a random position and then looks down. If there’s any skin of the apple left in the spot where he plans to take a bite, then he will indeed take that bite. But if there’s no skin there (i.e., he’s already taken bites at that spot), he won’t take a bite and will rotate the apple for another minute. Once he has bitten off all the skin of the apple, he’s done eating.
<br><br>
Suppose the apple is a sphere with a radius of 4 centimeters, and that each bite of the apple is a circle of the sphere whose radius, as measured along the apple’s curved surface, is 1 centimeter. On average, how many minutes will it take this 2-year-old to eat the apple?
</blockquote>

<h5>Solution</h5>
<p>This week's answer is not perfectly precise, as I used a monte carlo simulation. Furthermore, because of the complexity of the problem, I was only able to run 10,000 scenarios, which means there is likely some variance in my answer compared to the "true" result. In any case, I can say with confidence that the toddler will be eating this apple for quite some time: <strong>on average, it will take roughly 550 minutes (more than 9 hours), to completely finish the snack.</strong></p>
<p>Of course, because the process is random, each apple will be eaten differently. I've illustrated one scenario in the gif below. The apple is projected onto 2-dimensions (just like a map of the globe). Each red dot represents a point of skin on the apple's surface. At each step, the toddler chooses a random location, takes a bite, and the points in a nearby circle turn yellow. This gif shows just the first 150 bites, and it's not nearly enough to finish the apple. In fact this particular simulation doesn't finish until the 557th bite!</p>
<p><img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" src="../images/20200508-riddler.gif"></p>
<p>(I also found it fascinating to note how each bite is projected in two dimensions. Obviously each bite is a perfect circle on the 3-dimensional apple, but in this 2-dimensional projection, the bites can becomes distorted. Bites near the equator are nearly circular in shape, but bites near the poles become increasingly stretched out, owing to this particular method of projecting the globe into two dimensions. This is the exact same phenomena that makes Greenland look enormous on maps of the world.)</p>
<p>In addition to this single scenario, we can also view the distribution of all 10,000 simulations. This chart shows a histogram of the number of bites it took for every apple to be eaten. The results range from roughly 200 minutes (3+ hours), to 1200 minutes (20 hours!)</p>
<p><img class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" src="../images/20200508-riddler.png"></p>
<h5>Methodology</h5>
<p>This was a challenging problem, and the only way I could think to tackle it was to simulate the process. In addition, rather than modeling the apple as a continuous, smooth sphere, I modeled a network of "sensors" scattered randomly and uniformly across its surface. I tracked whether each sensor still contained skin, and the simulation ended once all sensors had been "eaten". With a large enough number of sensors, e.g. 50,000, there should be little accuracy lost compared to a continuous model, and counting the sensors simplifies the problem significantly.</p>
<p>Before I dive into the details, I also found it helpful to list the steps needed to solve this problem. These are like "sub-problems" that each contribute to the overall solution. Each of these problems presented its own unique challenges.</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose a point randomly and uniformly on the apple's surface.</li>
<li>Once a point is chosen, determine the area of the "bite".</li>
<li>After each bite, track the total area of skin remaining.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's review how to solve each of these.</p>
<p><strong><em>Choose a random point on the apple's surface</em></strong></p>
<p>A pitfall to avoid here is that many algorithms for choosing uniform points in two dimensions will not be uniform in three dimensions. As an example, suppose you start by generating a random latitude (-90° to 90°) and longitude (-180° to 180°), then plotting that point on the sphere. After many iterations, you will find that your points are concentrated near the poles, and not uniformly distributed across the sphere's surface. This happens because each ring of latitude (which is chosen with the same probability) is a different size on the sphere: the rings near the equator are much larger, and points will be more spread out than the rings near the poles, which are smaller and more dense.</p>
<p>Fortunately, this problem is well known, and many <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/SpherePointPicking.html">algorithms</a> exist to choose uniform points on the surface of a sphere. The next decision we have to make is what coordinate system we want to use. I chose cartesian coordinates, expessed as $(x, y, z)$, in particular because it makes the next step easier.</p>
<p>In the python program I wrote, you can generate a random point on the surface of the apple easily. However, it's not quite as easy to imagine where those points are on the surface. I also included a method to be able to translate between cartesian and latitude/longitude systems.</p>

<p><strong><em>Determine the bite area</em></strong></p>
<p>I chose to operate primarily in cartesian coordinates because it is easy to calculate "great circle distance". Great circle distance is the shortest distance between two points along the surface of the sphere. It's the path that an ant would take to walk from A to B. In this problem, a bite includes points up to 1cm away from the initial point. I wrote a method that returns all points within a certain radius, which will give us the points affected by a bite.</p>

<p><strong><em>Track the total area of skin remaining</em></strong></p>
<p>Now that we have a way to choose random points and calculate the size of a bite, we need a way to track the status of each sensor. One way to do this is to keep a <code>set</code> of sensors on the apple's surface that still have skin. Every time we take a bite, some sensors may be removed from this set if they are included in the bite. Once the set has zero elements (no more skin on the apple), then the simulation ends. In python, the <code>eat</code> method performs one simulation and returns the number of bites it took to eat the apple.</p>

</pre></div>


<h5>Full Code</h5>
<p>This week's solution is brute force and inefficient. It took several hours to generate 10,000 simulations. However, I think the logical flow of the program makes sense, and could be improved in the future. I created a <code>Sphere</code> class that has methods related to spheres, and an <code>Apple</code> class that inherits these methods in order to solve the problem. In particular there are methods for each of the steps above, like choosing random points, converting between coordinate systems, and simulating an apple being eaten.</p>

<span class="sd">    This class represents an Apple as a sphere with radius r. This class will be</span>
<span class="sd">    used to solve the Riddler Classic from May 8, 2020, found here:</span>
<span class="sd">    fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-you-eat-an-apple-like-a-toddler/</span>

<span class="sd">    The basic approach is to model the Apple as a sphere with a fixed number of</span>
<span class="sd">    discrete &quot;sensor&quot; points spread uniformly and randomly across its surface.</span>
<span class="sd">    The sensors are used to track whether that particular point on the Apple</span>
<span class="sd">    still contains skin. With enough sensors, we approach a continuous model of</span>
<span class="sd">    the Apple&#39;s surface.</span>

<span class="sd">    Ultimately, to answer the Riddler, call the `eat` method, which will run a</span>
<span class="sd">    monte carlo simulation of taking bites until all skin has been eaten.</span>
